			<h2>Routing in Simple Polygons</h2>
			<p>We first have a very important result we will use many times in the following theorems. 
			It is the simplest case, but, as in many cases in mathematics, it provides a strong 'block' to be able to build the next results easily. 
			The theorem has two parts, the second one being the most significant.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>1. Given a simple polygon P, int(n/2) - 1 beacons are sometimes necessary to route between any pair of points in P.</h3>
			<h4>Proof</h4>
			<p>It is sufficient to provide an example of a simple polygon in which we would need int(n/2) - 1 beacons to route between 
			any pair of points in P, focusing on an extreme pair.</p>
			<p>In figure 1, we can see a simple polygon of 11 vertices. If we look at points G and F, to be able to take G to F’s position we will have 
			to place 4 beacons in the green vertices. This is caused by the fact that G will tend to get stuck in every spike during its journey to F,
			so we must place one beacon per spike, 4 in total ( int(11/2) – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4).</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>2. Given a simple polygon P, int(n/2) - 1 beacons are always sufficient to route between any pair of points in P.</h3>
			<h4>Proof</h4>
			<p>We will present an algorithm to place int(n/2) – 1 beacons in any simple polygon in such a way we can route between any pair of points in it.</p>
			<p>Firstly, we will triangulate the polygon. Considering this triangulation, we will peel off triangles starting with an extreme triangle 
			(lowest leaf of the dual graph associated to that triangulation) in each iteration. These removed triangles will mean “routed territory”, that 
			is to say, a part of the polygon in which we can route between any pair of points with the beacons already placed.</p>
			<p>There will be two types of extremes triangles a = ABC, as shown below:</p>
			<p>How are we going to place the beacons in our peeling off?</p>
			<p>In the case of figure 1, we will put a beacon Z in C. This way, any point in the three triangles can navigate to Z if attracted by it and vice versa. 
			We note it will be analogous if we had a hypothetic BDE instead of CDE.<br/>
			The second case is a bit more complicated, as we have to consider 4 triangles instead of 3. Here we will use something stronger than attraction, visibility, 
			which will be useful afterwards. Then we cannot put Z in C, as F may be to the left of line BC. But, considering the point B, we will be able to see triangles 
			ABC and BDF from it. Therefore we could put a beacon Z in B and we would have visibility over every triangle shown in the figure except DCE, but this will not 
			affect the future proof. All in all, every point before segment CD will be visible to Z and therefore every point could be routed to or from Z. (*)</p>
